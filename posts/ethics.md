## HEDONISM
Hedonism is the overarching category of theories in which the main goal is pleasure.

There are many different ideologies that are centered around a hedonistic goal; where the main idea is to maximize pleasure.ยน
Due to the overwhelming amount of different hedonistic theories, this hedonism label will be divided into different sub categories.
## CONSEQUENTIALISM
Consequentialism believes that the ethicality of an action is defined by the outcomes of said act.

### UTILITARIANISM

Overall, utilitarianism is a family of beliefs that judge morally based on how much it benefits. This means that an action or event would be considered morally correct if it helps the most people.  
Yet even this idea can be broken down into many other specifics; some utilitarians believe that pleasure and happiness determines how beneficial it is, while others may see other factors as more important when discussing how utilitarian a decision is. 

Classical utilitarianism focuses on maximizing pleasure, combining the ideas of hedonism as well as consequentialism. Two main names come up when talking about classical utilitarianism: Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill. While both write about classical utilitarianism, they do have slightly differing views.

## DEONTOLOGY
Deontology is a group of ideas where the intention of an action determines how ethical it is.
Deontology was an idea first started
An example provided by the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy says:

## TROLLEY PROBLEM
One of the most famous ethical thought experiments (especially when discussing consequentialism and deontology) is the Trolley Problem. 
There are two scenarios: You are the driver of a trolley, when the tolley suddenly malfunctions and is unable to stop. On the track ahead, there are 5 workers; all of whom would be killed if they got hit. 
Now, with the trolley barrelling down, you see a second track you can turn onto; where a sole worker is standing. Do you turn the trolley onto the second track? This first scenario gives you two options: You can either continue down the lane and kill five workers, or turn the trolley but kill the sole worker. 
What do you choose to do? 

The second scenario is similar to the first, but with a couple differences: 
You are a bystander, witnessing the out-of-control trolley speeding down a single track, where there are 5 workers; all of whom would be killed if they got hit, as before. 
Now, beside you, there stands a very large individual. They are standing right beside the track. Their body weight would be able to stop the trolley in its tracks, but they would be killed in the fall. 
Do you push the individual onto the tracks?

This thought experiment is a prime example of deontological thinking vs consequential thinking.
